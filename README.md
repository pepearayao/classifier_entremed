# Entremed Classifier

Classifier project to sort job offers for entremed. Will be using database of
webscrapper jobs made by me.

Tried different algos and notebooks include NLP and ML to identify main
items but has proven unsuccessfull as there is no labeled data.

That is why will first develop a classifier using regex and pandas mainly.
No other way.
